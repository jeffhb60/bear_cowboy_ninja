# Bear Cowboy Ninja Game

This is a simple graphical game implemented in Python using the tkinter library, where a user plays against the CPU. The game is inspired by "Rock, Paper, Scissors," but with a fun twist: the choices are Bear, Cowboy, and Ninja. The game keeps track of user wins, CPU wins, and ties, and provides a final score summary when the user chooses to exit.
